# Linear_Regression_Case_Study

I am a data science enthusiast skilled in applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. Recently, I worked on a Linear Regression case study focused on predicting insurance costs using demographic and health-related factors. The project involved data cleaning, handling missing values, outlier detection, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

I implemented a supervised learning model using Scikit-learn’s Linear Regression algorithm, evaluating performance through metrics like R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE). This project enhanced my understanding of feature relationships, model interpretation, and data-driven decision-making. I’m passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights and continuously improving my analytical and machine learning skills.
